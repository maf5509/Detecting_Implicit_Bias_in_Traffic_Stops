With the increasing awareness of difficult encounters between law enforcement and members of minority communities, many have called for changes in the way police officers are trained and monitored in their dealings with the public. In any area of human interaction, one of the most difficult problems to detect is implicit bias.

## Available Data

This study was conducted using police traffic stop data collected between October 2013 and September 2015 and posted online by the Connecticut Racial Profiling Prohibition Project. The aim of the project is to monitor and combat racial profiling in interactions between the police and road users. 

The dataset consisted of 857,895 observations recorded from CT police interactions from 2013-15. 

## Selected Findings

- Black males and Latino males are more likely than average, to a statistically significant degree, to have their car searched during a traffic stop whose original purpose was non-investigative.

- Black males are less likely than average to be found to be in possession of contraband. White males are more likely than average to be found to be in possession of contraband, as a result of these non-investigative searches.

## Techniques Used

t-testing; various supervised learning models including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, Ridge Regression, LASSO, KNN; evaluation techniques including cross-validation, AUC.
